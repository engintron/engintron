# === MICRO CACHING ===
# 1 second (1s) micro-caching enabled for all proxied dynamic HTML content
# If you wish to have longer cache times, change the "proxy_cache_valid"
# line from "1s" to whatever time you want (e.g. "30s" or "1m").
# This cache is turned off when certain criteria are met, e.g. when a site
# manager logs into WordPress' backend/admin section.

#############################################################################################
# ADVANCED USERS ONLY:
# This setting is for cPanel servers with only one to a few sites & NO user-generated content
# in the frontend (no forums, no e-commerce sites, no user logins!) - you have been warned!
# Use the time defined in "$EXPIRES_FOR_DYNAMIC" to force client-side caching on dynamic content
# (set to 1m by default). To enable, uncomment all lines located at the bottom of this file.
# You can also raise "proxy_cache_valid" to the same value (e.g. "1m") to force longer
# server-side caching.
# The combination of these settings will have Nginx serve all content without issuing requests
# to Apache but to refresh its cache.
